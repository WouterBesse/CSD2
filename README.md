# My CSD2 school projects
A repository I use to do my schoolwork. <br>
Here you can find all the projects that I had to make for the second year of M&T at HKU.

## All projects:
### Python Basics `CSD2a/python_basics`
A simple hello world which was used to get used to the python language. Not a very exciting script.

### Sample Sequencer v1 `CSD2a/single_sample_sequencer`
A simple sample sequencer which can play a melody and drum sequence at the same time.<br>
Also has a program to write your own sequences, contains a bug related to saving midi.<br>
To learn more about this program, you can find its readme in `CSD2a/single_sample_sequencer/doc/readme.md`

### Sample Sequencer v2 `CSD2a/eindopdracht`
A continuation of the first sample sequencer, also the final project of the first semester of CSD.<br>
A sequencer that can play a melody, drum sequencer and in the future maybe more at the same time.<br>
Completely rewritten the note and drum player to work on the same thread, to avoid the midi saving bug.<br>

### Playful Synth `CSD2d/Playful Synth`
The final project for the 4th semester of CSD, this contains both the Playful Music app project and the audio visualiser<br>
This is a fun synthesizer you can play with in your browser and sculpt cool sound for.<br>
It's designed to engage the user and let you explore sound.
