Hello, this is the documentation for my basic python projects.

Helloworld.py works perfectly and was fun to make. Just try it, it even tells what time of day it is!

Playsound.py ask you what sound to play and how many times to play it. I wouldn't recommend making the number too high since the samples are a bit long.
It actually took more effort than expected to get playsound.py to work, because paths in powershell are weird and simpleaudio won't work in unix.
