Hello, this is the documentation for my basic python projects.

Helloworld.py works perfectly and was fun to make. Just try it, it even tells what time of day it is!

Playsound.py should theoretically work, but I haven't been able to get simpleaudio to work so I cant test it. Gotta ask help with this in class.
