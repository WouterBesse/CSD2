Here is my simple sequencer.
Right now it only plays drum sounds but soon it will also play synth notes.

If you just want to test out the sequencer, just commence single_sample_sequencer.py

You can also modify the sequence data that the sequencer plays.
You can just open my simple sequencer_config.py script
